# JAD Session – Stakeholder Responses (NovaCart)

## 1. Business Context & Strategic Alignment

**Q1: What is NovaCart's biggest business challenge today in terms of sales and customer retention?**

**A:** Our primary challenge is the high cart abandonment rate (~35%) and low repeat purchase rate. Customers often browse multiple products but leave without completing transactions. Apart from that, retention is weak because we don’t offer personalized experiences or timely support.

**Q2: Why do you think customers abandon their carts most often? How does leadership view this problem?**

**A:** Leadership sees cart abandonment as **both a sales issue and a customer experience issue** . Customers leave due to unclear shipping info, limited personalized offers, and delayed responses to queries.

**Q3: What do you believe will make customers stay longer and complete purchases?**

**A:** Personalized recommendations, timely assistance via a chatbot, clear pricing, and incentives like targeted discounts. Also, minimizing friction in checkout (fast, transparent process) helps.

**Q4: Where do you see the role of AI and automation in NovaCart's 1–2 year strategy?**

**A:** AI should drive personalization (product suggestions, promotions) and automate Tier-1 support queries. Automation will free human agents for complex issues and enable proactive engagement.

**Q5: If this initiative succeeds, what would 'success' look like for you?**

**A:** Reduced cart abandonment to ~25%, improved conversion rate by 15%, higher CSAT and NPS, and 20% lower operational costs for support.

## 2. Customer Journey & Pain Points

**Q1: Can you walk me through a typical customer journey today?**

**A:** Customers land on the homepage → browse categories → view product details → add items to cart → initiate checkout → payment → order confirmation.

**Q2: At which point in the journey do the customers most often drop off?**

**A:** Drop-offs are highest at checkout, especially when shipping costs, delivery timelines, or discounts aren’t clear.

**Q3: What feedback have you received from customers about the shopping or checkout experience?**

**A:** Customers mention lack of instant answers to product or order questions, unclear promotions, and insufficient personalized recommendations.

**Q4: What are the most common reasons customers reach out to support during their shopping journey?**

**A:** Queries on order tracking, returns, product availability, discount eligibility, and delivery timelines.

## 3. Chatbot Scope & Capabilities

**Q1: What kind of customer queries should the chatbot handle?**

**A:** Tier-1 queries: order tracking, product information, return/exchange policy, troubleshooting common checkout issues, and promotion eligibility.

**Q2: Should the chatbot assist pre-purchase decisions or only post-purchase?**

**A:** Both — pre-purchase assistance for recommendations and promotions, and post-purchase support for tracking, returns, or FAQs.

**Q3: Do you want the chatbot to initiate conversations?**

**A:** Yes, proactive engagement for abandoned carts, promotions, and recommending complementary products.

**Q4: How should escalation to a human agent work?**

**A:** Escalation should be seamless. If the chatbot cannot resolve an issue in two interactions, it should transfer to a live agent, preserving conversation history.

**Q5: Should the chatbot support multiple languages?**

**A:** Yes, initially English, with plans to expand to other key languages as NovaCart grows.

## 4. Personalization & Dynamic Pricing

**Q1: What level of personalization do you want?**

**A:** Personalized product recommendations, dynamic discounts based on cart value and customer behavior, targeted promotions for loyalty program members.

**Q2: Should personalization be based on browsing history, purchase history, or both?**

**A:** Both — browsing history helps with real-time suggestions; purchase history allows smarter recommendations and loyalty-based offers.

**Q3: Do you want to provide real-time cart-based discounts?**

**A:** Yes, like the example you gave: “Complete your purchase in the next 30 minutes to get 10% off.”

**Q4: How should loyalty programs be incorporated?**

**A:** Personalized promotions based on loyalty tier, points, or past purchases. High-tier customers may get early access to deals or free shipping incentives.

## 5. KPIs & Success Metrics

**Q1: Which KPIs matter most?**

**A:** Cart abandonment rate, checkout conversion rate, CSAT, NPS, repeat purchases, and revenue per visitor.

**Q2: By how much do you want to reduce cart abandonment within 6–12 months?**

**A:** Target: 10% reduction in 6 months, reaching ~25% total by 12 months.

**Q3: How do you want to measure chatbot success?**

**A:** Resolution rate of Tier-1 queries, average response time (<2 seconds), customer satisfaction score post-interaction.

**Q4: What is the acceptable budget and timeline for this project?**

**A:** Budget: ~$150k–200k. Timeline: phased rollout in 3 months for MVP, full integration in 6–8 months.

---

## 6. Risks, Constraints & Compliance

**Q1: What risks do you foresee with customers interacting with the chatbot instead of a human?**

**A:** Customer distrust, inability to resolve complex queries, potential negative sentiment if escalation is delayed.

**Q2: Are there any data privacy or compliance policies we must adhere to?**

**A:** GDPR, PCI-DSS for payment info, and Indian IT Act regulations. All customer data must be encrypted and anonymized where necessary.

**Q3: Are there existing integrations or technology constraints?**

**A:** The chatbot and recommendation engines must integrate with the current OMS and CRM. Limited IT bandwidth requires a phased implementation.

## 7. Future Considerations

**Q1: Beyond chatbot + personalization, what other innovations would you like to see?**

**A:** Voice search support, AR-based product visualization, AI-driven email campaigns, and predictive inventory recommendations.

**Q2: Should this solution scale globally or just for current customer base?**

**A:** Initially domestic focus; architecture should support future global expansion.

**Q3: How important is omnichannel consistency?**

**A:** Very important — chatbot and personalization should provide consistent experiences across website, mobile app, WhatsApp, and social media platforms.
