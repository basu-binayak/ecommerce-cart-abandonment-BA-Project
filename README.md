# 🛒 NovaCart E-commerce Cart Abandonment Project (Business Analyst Portfolio)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world Business Analyst case study for a fictitious e-commerce company, **NovaCart**, facing high **cart abandonment rates** ( **\*Cart Abandonment Rate** is an e-commerce metric that shows the percentage of online shoppers who add items to their cart but leave the website or app without completing the purchase\* )

$$
\text{Cart Abandonment Rate (\%)} = \frac{\text{Number of Abandoned Carts}}{\text{Number of Initiated Carts}} \times 100
$$

Or equivalently:

$$
\text{Cart Abandonment Rate (\%)} = 1 - \frac{\text{Number of Completed Purchases}}{\text{Number of Initiated Carts}} \times 100
$$

**As a Business Analyst, I worked on bridging the business problem into a technical solution** involving:

- 🤖 AI-driven Chatbot (real-time customer support)
- 🎯 Recommendation Engine (personalized suggestions)
- 💰 Dynamic Pricing (targeted discounts & promotions)

The goal was to **reduce cart abandonment** and **increase checkout conversion rates** while balancing customer experience and business margins.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

**Customers abandon carts due to poor personalized experience and lack of real-time support.**

- Current cart abandonment rate: **XX%** (baseline from analytics)
- Lost revenue estimate: **$X million/year**
- Key business objective: **Reduce abandonment by 10–15%** and **increase AOV (Average Order Value)**.

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Cart Abandonment Rate** = (Add_to_cart − Purchases) / Add_to_cart
- **Checkout Conversion Rate** = Purchases / Begin_checkout
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**
- **Chat metrics**: engagement rate, resolution rate
- **Recommender metrics**: CTR, add-to-cart-from-recommendation
- **Pricing metrics**: discount usage, margin impact

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Techniques Used

- **BA Tools:** Journey Mapping, Stakeholder Analysis, Hypothesis Prioritization (ICE/RICE)
- **Documentation:** BRD, FRD, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, Test Cases
- **Data Analysis:** SQL (funnel analysis), Excel/Sheets (prioritization)
- **Design:** Figma / Draw.io (journey maps, wireframes, flows)
- **Experimentation:** A/B test design

---

## 🚀 Outcomes (Hypothetical Example)

- Reduced cart abandonment by **12%** after introducing chatbot & recommendations.
- Increased AOV by **7%** via cross-sell recommendations.
- Improved customer satisfaction (CSAT) by **15 points** through real-time support.

---

## 🧩 Next Steps

- Expand chatbot intents (refunds, loyalty enrollment)
- Move from rule-based pricing to ML-based price elasticity models
- Extend recommendations to homepage & email campaigns
